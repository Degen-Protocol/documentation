</Callout>

## Costs
 - 200 DAI initial deposit
 - 200 DAI to compound earnings
 - Regular gas fees

## Rewards
 - 0.5% DAI / 24 hours
 - 0.5% referral rewards on claim by referrals

## Strategy
You can grow or manage your Feeder position however you like - However, the best strategy is the recommended "21/7" or "3/1". Over a period of 1 month (assuming 30 days), you would:
 - Compound once per week (200 DAI deposit), for 3 weeks in a row.
 - Claim once, for the month.
 - Rinse and Repeat!
